        "  \n",

His key achievements included universal Pre-K and 3-K, easing childcare burdens, and streamlining social services. These gains reversed in the pandemic’s first year.\n",

        "  Adams, elected on a moderate platform, focused on crime, economic recovery, and supporting small businesses [(Get Stuff Done, 2024)](https://www.nyc.gov/content/getstuffdone/pages/initiatives). Under his administration, cash-assistance recipients rose by 23%, while staffing shortages and an asylum crisis strained services [(Family, 2022)](https://www.icph.org/reports/family-homelessness-in-new-york-city-what-the-adams-administration-can-learn-from-previous-mayoralties/#keeping-new-yorkers-housed-homelessness-prevention-vouchers-and-housing).

I fetched data from the subreddits with mention of 311, including /nyc, /AskNYC, /newyorkcity, /NYChousing, and /311. I limited the time frame of my search to January 1, 2020 - December 31, 2023, gathering two years of data for each administration.\n",

        "I used the Python Reddit API Wrapper (PRAW) which is open to the public. To scrape the date, I created a Reddit account following Reddit’s API Documentation (Reddit Dev Api) then created a personal use script to pull the data. Reddit imposes rate limits of 100 requests per limit, which made it challenging to test my code and pull the data. This also limited my capacity to expand my searches.\n",
        "\n",
        "To compare the Reddit data to citywide 311 service requests, I downloaded 311 Service Request Data from Open Data NYC, a public database of data generated by various NYC agencies and other City organizations. Before downloading the csv file, I queried the data on the website to extract from January 1, 2020 - December 31, 2023 and reduced the columns from 41 down to seven. I had previously attempted to scrape the data through Open Data’s API for Python, but was unable to import it due to the volume of rows. I also had to narrow my search due to data size.\n"

Key terms analyzed included “housing,” “benefits,” “shelter,” “wait,” “delays,” “budget,” “immigration,” “migrant,” “covid,” “blasio,” “adams,” “wage,” “employment,” and “rent.” Sentiment analysis was conducted using VADER, focusing on changes across administrations, particularly for topics like housing shortages and delays in benefits access. Keywords with fewer than 10 occurrences were excluded as less relevant. Surprisingly low counts for “migration” and “Blasio” reflected possible shifts in public focus."

I imagine this is happening nationwide since the pandemic, but it\\u2019s probably more palpable in a city like New York where walking is so common, and you can visually see foot traffic increase, or decrease, at major transportation hubs. The major transportation hubs where I\\u2019ve noticed reduced foot traffic the most are the Union Square station, and the Times Square station, particularly on the weekends. I understand why the foot traffic is reduced at these hubs during the work week (WFH), but why is the foot traffic reduced at these stations on the weekends as well? The weekend foot traffic at these hubs wouldn\\u2019t have been as dependent on office workers, it would have been comprised more of tourists, and just New Yorkers going out on a Friday, or Saturday. So, why is the foot traffic still so reduced at these transportation hubs on the weekends, over a year after the pandemic \\u201cended\\u201d? From what I\\u2019ve read, tourism is expected to return this year to almost its pre-pandemic highs, so it\\u2019s likely not a lack of tourism. Are New Yorkers just not going out as much as they used to pre-pandemic? Has the pandemic resulted in New Yorkers not only working from home, but also ordering food instead of going to restaurants? Streaming movies, instead of going to the theater? Face timing with friends in their apartment, instead of meeting at a coffee shop, or bar? Are people from the outer boroughs just not coming into Manhattan on the weekends as much as they did previously? When I walk through these two subway stations on the weekends, that used to be filled to the brim with people, and there\\u2019s only about a third of the foot traffic there was pre-pandemic - what could be the explanation for this, other than New Yorkers just not being out, and about, in the ways we were previously?\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"created_utc\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 37519294,\n        \"min\": 1577893232,\n        \"max\": 1699828490,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 100,\n        \"samples\": [\n          1604850798,\n          1584104495,\n          1645678707\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"top_parent_comment\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 96,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"If you come to Williamsburg you can just have my Taylor GS mini, haven't touched it in years\",\n          \"The hell is up with those numbers?!\",\n          \"Almost exclusively a sausage fest.

        "To analyze the sentiment of the keywords with a frequency distribution greater than 10, I took the average sentiment from the post sentiment column. Budget and Wage have the highest sentiment score. This likely alludes to the liminations of sentiment analysis - both of these keywords were viewed positively in the press or in anlysis of the mayors' administrations. Budget, particularly during the Adams administration was highly criticized as he cut the budget of all agencies by 5% and threated to significantly reduce library and senior services. Benefits had the highest sentiment score at 0.99, which could highlight the increase in benefits during the Covid pandemic or just show that Reddit users speak positively about benefits offered in NYC. Wage also had a high sentiment score under de Blasio, surprising given the percentage of people unemployed.\n",

The low rating of shelter from 2020 - 2023 aligns with my hypothesis that shelter would be perceived as negative during the timeframe. This is when shelters were at capacity due to the migrant crisis. Adams also has the lowest sentiment score."

        "The top 20 most common Reddit keywords (e.g., \"feel,\" \"one,\" \"day,\" \"work\") lacked direct policy relevance, limiting insights. Sorting by a predefined keyword list provided clearer comparisons. During de Blasio's tenure, words like \"immigration,\" \"migrant,\" \"Adams,\" and \"budget\" had fewer than 10 mentions. Similarly, Adams' tenure showed low mentions for \"immigration,\" \"benefits,\" and \"shelter.\" Notably, \"shelter\" was mentioned 11 more times during de Blasio’s period, potentially linked to pandemic-related policies. \"Covid\" appeared 35% more during de Blasio’s term, aligning with its pandemic peak. Surprisingly, \"benefits\" were mentioned 53 times under de Blasio but only 3 under Adams, despite criticism of benefit cuts during the latter's administration.\n",
        "\n",
        "*Sentiment Analysis*\n",
        "\n",
        " Sentiment analysis revealed contrasts between administrations. During Adams’ tenure, positive sentiment appeared for \"benefits\" (0.71) and \"budget\" (0.25), while \"shelter\" (-0.51) reflected dissatisfaction. Sentiment for \"Adams\" (0.0003) was neutral, defying expectations of stronger opinions. It was surprising that the budget was not associated with more negative sentiment because the Adams administration has faced complaints from City Council and other government agencies about budget cuts. Shelter’s negative sentiment corresponds with my hypothesis that shelter would be viewed unfavorably during the Adams administration.\n",
        "\n",
        "De Blasio’s period showed more positive sentiment overall, with \"wage\" (0.77), \"budget\" (0.78), and \"benefits\" (0.77) scoring high.  Compared to the Adams timeframe, the majority of those times suggest that there was a more favorable perception around these themes. Budget was the only similarly high positive sentiment compared to Adams. Covid (0.15) and Wait (0.37) were of more mixed sentiment, suggesting a mix of views, but slightly more optimistic than during Adam’s tenure.\n",
        "\n",
        "Across most keywords, sentiment scores were significantly more positive during de Blasio’s tenure compared to Adam’s, especially for topics like Budget, Wage, and Housing. This corresponds with an increase in Covid-related programs to support wages and housing, expanding the budget as well. Discussions around Shelter were much more negative during Adams’ term, potentially indicating greater dissatisfaction with shelter policies. The Adams period showed more polarized sentiment, reflecting shifting public perceptions between the two administrations.\n",
        "\n",
        "A heatmap highlighted stark differences between administrations, with more polarized sentiment during Adams’ term. Word clouds showed \"Covid\" as dominant under de Blasio and \"wait\" and \"Adams\" prominent during Adams' tenure, aligning with heightened service delays and pandemic-era challenges.\n"

        "Among agencies, NYPD and HPD received the highest complaints, consistent with trends [(Council, 2024)](https://council.nyc.gov/data/311-agency/#:~:text=Top%20311%20Agency%20Responders,Department%20of%20Sanitation%20(DSNY)). Surprisingly, there was no significant increase in complaints related to welfare or human services under Adams, as hypothesized. \"Access\" was mentioned more under de Blasio, though still high across both periods.\n",
        "\n",
        "Keywords like \"housing,\" \"benefits,\" \"budget,\" \"migrant,\" and \"Covid\" had zero mentions in both administrations,  likely reflecting 311’s predefined complaint categories. There were some notable increases in complaints from de Blasio to Adams. “Shelter” increased by 22.5%, which could mirror the negative sentiment in Reddit, also indicating a potential growing concern or need for shelter-related services. “Wait” mentions rose by 55.2%, potentially highlighting the increase in benefit wait times during Adams term. “Immigration” complaints increased by 55.6%, likely indicating rising concerns about immigration services under Adams. \"Wage\" complaints also increased by 30%, potentially showing a heightened focus on wage-related issues. Conversely, complaints about \"employment\" dropped by 17.9%, and \"rent\" complaints declined by 8.7%. “Wage” had the highest number of mentions across both administrations, indicating that it is a significant issue for residents.\n",

        "Overall, shelter-related complaints rose significantly, mirroring negative Reddit sentiment, indicating increasing public concern for these services.\n"

        "#4. Discussion and Conclusion\n",
        "Several of my hypotheses were correct: during the de Blasio administration, frequent keywords in Reddit posts related to benefits, while under Adams, words like wait likely referred to delays in benefits enrollment. Sentiment around social services was notably more negative during the Adams administration, particularly regarding the term shelter, which may be tied to the rollback of the “Right to Shelter” policy. However, it is difficult to conclude a direct dependency on social services or to identify a significant difference in the volume of 311-related complaints between the two time periods.\n",
        "\n",
        "To expand upon this research, I would conduct a time series analysis for each keyword to observe how the frequency of mentions changes over time. Given the pandemic's potential influence, breaking mentions into monthly or weekly intervals could reveal clearer trends in public reactions to services. Additionally, combining Reddit and Open Data data sources to analyze frequency trends in parallel would provide a more comprehensive view.\n",
        "\n",
        "One key limitation of this research is the low volume of 311-related posts on Reddit, which may reflect the platform's demographics and its limited use for providing feedback on city services. Keywords in Reddit posts were more general and less frequent than anticipated, resulting in insufficient findings to identify policy gaps or inform decision-making.\n",
        "\n",
        "To address this, I plan to collect more data, refine the keyword search, and explore additional Reddit threads or alternative data sources. Instead of manually selecting keywords, I could use tools like ChatGPT or Claude to generate a list based on my research topic. I also aim to scrape data from subreddits focused on New York City social services, examining not only government-related threads but also discussions on how New Yorkers navigate unmet needs. Platforms like X (formerly Twitter), where 311 has a more active presence, could be valuable for this research, particularly if their APIs become accessible. Finally, expanding the scope to include other helplines, such as Cora, or nonprofit organizations could provide valuable insights into social service inquiries.\n",
        "\n",
        "There is a significant difference between the volume of 311 service requests and Reddit posts, likely due to how data is collected on each platform. On Reddit, users can freely post questions, share thoughts, or voice opinions, while 311 service requests are triaged. Callers may be redirected to other resources if their issue falls outside 311’s scope. For example, keywords like housing or homelessness may not appear if callers are referred to other agencies. Additionally, some agencies, like the Human Resources Administration (HRA), are not fully represented in the 311 dataset, further limiting insights into public perceptions.\n",
        "\n",
        "Furthermore, the populations that seek Reddit or 311 are quite different, which could also skew results. Reddit users are predominantly male, young, white, and well-educated [ (Barthel, Stocking, Holcomb, and Mitchell, 2016)](https://www.pewresearch.org/journalism/2016/02/25/reddit-news-users-more-likely-to-be-male-young-and-digital-in-their-news-preferences/), a demographic that does not typically rely on social services in New York. While this group may have opinions on major issues, their experiences likely differ from those of low-income or minority populations. Similarly, 311 users tend to skew toward older, white, well-educated females, another group less likely to access social services. Scraping data from additional platforms, such as Cora, could help address these discrepancies and provide a more representative view of social service inquiries.\n"
